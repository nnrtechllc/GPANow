## Introduction 👋

Marvin Ridge High School

Waxhaw, NC

SchoolMate is a mobile application made for iOS devices. To login into the app, users must first fill out their information on the "Register" page or authenticate using Google. Once in the app, users can view the home page, profile page, attendance page, fundraisers page, calendar page, and job listings page. On the home page, you can view other students' posts to like and see what is happening at school. On the profile page, you can view all your posts, delete those posts, log out of your account, or delete your account. On the attendance page, you can submit your daily attendance for that day. The fundraiser's page consists of different types of fundraisers going around at that given time. The calendar page is made to show a calendar with all the upcoming events integrated into it to enhance the user’s experience. The jobs listing page was created to help high school students find different jobs nearby that were currently hiring. This page will show each position available and if clicked, will show a description of that job and the pay of the job. To further enhance our app, we have also added a "store" where users can purchase clothes from their schools. We also have a section on our app titled "More" which consists of Settings and Report Bugs. On the Settings page, you can enter your personal information, switch dark mode on or off, change your password, subscribe to updates, and view the following documents: Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and About Us. On the "About Us" page in Settings, there is an email and a phone number included to 
directly communicate with us about any questions or concerns. SchoolMate is currently error-free, however, a bug-reporting system is implemented if the user later discovers an issue.

## Build Instructions 🔧
This mobile application was developed in SwiftUI using Xcode 14. Contained within the competition submission is a folder named "FBLAFinalApp2023". It contains all the necessary components and resources related to the mobile application's implementation and functionality. To successfully build and run the mobile application, it is essential to meet the Xcode 14 requirements. Xcode 14 beta necessitates a Mac computer running macOS Monterey 12.4 or a later version. Therefore, ensure that your Mac operating system is updated accordingly. To execute a debug version of the application, you will need to have Xcode installed on your Mac. Xcode provides the necessary development tools and resources for building and running iOS applications. Additionally, depending on the target platform, you have two options: FBLANavigator.Android: To run the Android version of the application, you can either use an Android emulator within Xcode or connect an Android mobile device to your Mac. If you opt for the latter, make sure that the Android device has Developer Options enabled, and USB debugging turned on. This allows the device to establish a connection with Xcode and run the debug version of the Android project. FBLANavigator.iOS: To run the iOS version of the application, you can utilize the iOS simulator within Xcode. The simulator provides a virtual environment for testing and debugging iOS apps without requiring a physical iOS device.
