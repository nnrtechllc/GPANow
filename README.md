## Appropriate Use of Comments, Naming Conventions, and Proper Formatting üí¨

In the development of GPANow, we prioritize clear communication and organization within our codebase. To achieve this, we adhere to the following principles:

### Comments:
- Each section of our code is thoroughly documented to provide insights into its purpose and functionality.
- Comments are logically placed and serve as a guide for developers to navigate through the code effortlessly.
- We ensure that our comments are meaningful and contribute to understanding the codebase.

### Naming Conventions:
- We follow consistent and descriptive naming conventions for variables, functions, and components.
- Clear and intuitive names enhance readability and maintainability, making it easier for developers to comprehend and modify the code.

### Proper Formatting:
- Our codebase is formatted in a consistent and organized manner, following industry-standard formatting guidelines.
- Proper indentation, spacing, and code structure improve readability and make the codebase more accessible to developers.

## Appropriate Use of Classes, Modules, and Components üß©

- **Classes**: We ensure that each programming element is appropriately utilized and accurately placed within the codebase. Classes are employed to encapsulate related data and methods, promoting the object-oriented principles.
  
- **Modules**: Through our modules, our app achieves a structured architecture, making it easier to maintain and extend its features. Our imported modules include GitHub, Firebase, and Apple package dependencies.

- **Components**: Components are employed to create self-contained units of functionality within the application, which abides by the law of encapsulation.

## User Input Validation üõ°Ô∏è

- **Syntactical Validation**: We've incorporated syntactical validation methods to ensure that the data entered by users conforms to the expected format and structure. For example, when users input their grades, we verify that they're using the correct format, such as letter grades or numerical scores.

- **Semantical Validation**: In addition to syntactical validation, we've implemented semantical validation to ensure that the data makes logical sense within our application. This involves validating not only the format but also the content. For instance, we check that the grades entered fall within the expected range for a given course.

- **Advanced Validation Techniques**: We've gone beyond basic validation by implementing more advanced techniques. This includes cross-field validation to check for relationships between different input fields, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the entered data.
